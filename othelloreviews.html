			Othello, directed by the visionary Flavio Boccelli, is a gripping masterpiece that blends intensity with stunning
			theatricality. Jack Whitehall’s Iago is chillingly manipulative, his charm masking a sinister core, while Richard
			Hammond’s Othello delivers surprising emotional depth, capturing the tragic unraveling of a noble man. With its bold
			staging and hauntingly raw performances, this production will linger long in the minds of its audience."</p>

			<td><p><b>Patrick Kielty <a href = 'https://www.independent.ie/' target = '_blank'>(The Sunday Independent, 2023)</a>: </b>"Flavio Boccelli’s
			Othello is a bold reimagining that delivers tension and heartbreak in equal measure. Jack Whitehall dazzles as Iago,
			delivering sly humor alongside terrifying malice, while Richard Hammond brings a grounded vulnerability to Othello’s
			descent into jealousy. Though the pacing occasionally falters, the compelling performances and striking visual design
			make this an unforgettable interpretation of Shakespeare’s tragedy."</p>

			<td><p><b>Annie McDonald <a href = 'https://www.thesun.ie/' target = '_blank'>(The Sun, 2022)</a>: </b>“Jack Whitehall’s chillingly
			charismatic Iago and Richard Hammond’s deeply human Othello are the heart of Cast Eyes Theatre Company’s
			electrifying Othello, directed with precision by Flavio Boccelli. The production’s modern aesthetic and
			emotional authenticity heighten the tension, creating a visceral exploration of jealousy, betrayal, and love.
			A triumph of acting and direction that must not be missed.”</p>
