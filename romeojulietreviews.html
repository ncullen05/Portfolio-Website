			<td><p><b>Michael Lester <a href = 'https://www.irishtimes.com/' target = '_blank'>(The Irish Times, 2023)</a>: </b>“WildRice delivers a breathtaking rendition of Romeo and Juliet
			that feels as fresh as it is timeless. From the stunning set design to the hauntingly beautiful lighting,
			every visual detail feels carefully curated to transport the audience to Verona. But it's the cast’s
			dynamic energy and the palpable chemistry between leads William Smith and Thomas Holland that elevate this production.
			The balcony scene left not a dry eye in the house, and the final act was heartbreakingly intense.
			WildRice proves once again why they are a company to watch. I cannot wait to come back next year."</p>

			<td><p><b>John Fenton <a href = 'https://www.independent.ie/' target = '_blank'>(The Sunday Independent, 2023)</a>: </b>“A raw, passionate interpretation that makes you fall in love with Romeo and Juliet
			all over again. WildRice’s use of minimalist staging, combined with powerful, emotive performances, brings the story’s
			youthful desperation to the forefront. Thomas Holland as Juliet is a revelation; her emotional range from innocence to
			defiance to despair is captivating. The production’s modern twist on costuming also adds a refreshing edge.
			While some liberties were taken in certain scenes, the overall effect is profoundly moving.”</p>

			<td><p><b>Mick Gallagher <a href = 'https://www.thesun.ie/' target = '_blank'>(The Sun, 2022)</a>: </b>“WildRice’s 'Romeo and Juliet' is nothing short of a triumph. The creative vision of director
			Ivan Heng shines throughout, with poetic staging and a captivating blend of traditional and contemporary elements.
			The choreography of the fight scenes, especially between Tybalt (played masterfully by Jennifer Aniston) and Mercutio (Denzel Washington),
			was visceral and exhilarating. The choice to set the play against a minimalist urban backdrop allowed the actors' intense performances
			to take center stage. This is Shakespeare at its most accessible, relatable, and raw.”</p>
